 # Background and Conviction

 I have a background in animal production.
 Earlier, i was aware that animal husbandry is one of the contributors in the climate change.If it's one, then we can't ignore it.From this fact, we must find a way to make animal husbandry more sustainable. And, i convince coding can help us solve this problem.
