 **Background and Conviction** 
 I have a background in animal production. Earlier, i was aware that animal husbandry is one of the contributors in the climate change. If it's one, then we can't ignore it. From this fact, we must find a way to make animal husbandry more sustainable. And, i convince coding can help us solve this problem.
