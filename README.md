# Backgroud and conviction

I have a background in animal production.  
iam aware that animal husbandry is one the contributors in the climate change.  
If it's one,then we can't ignore it.  
From this fact,we must find a way to make animal husbandry sustainable.  
And,i convince coding can help us solve this problem.  

# Interests  

I really interrested in solving problems using code.  
What,i love in that field is that you can build a cathedral from scratch.
